      align-items moves content vertically
        start
        center
        end

        wrap -> wrappes the children horizontally when a width reduces less than child width
        nowrap -> shrinks the width of the children to accommodate inside parent
    
    direction -> column: children placed in single column
      justify-content moves content vertically
        start
        center
        end

        space-around
        space-between
      
      align-items moves content horizontally
